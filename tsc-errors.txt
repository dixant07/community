src/services/repositories/BaseRepository.ts(253,32): error TS2352: Conversion of type '{ isDeleted: boolean; deletedAt: string; }' to type 'Partial<Omit<T, "id" | "createdAt">>' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
